                <h2>Supermakets</h2>
                 <p>As a student, you will mostly be searching for cost friendly supermarkets around the campus area, so here are some of the most visited:<br>
<ul>
    <li><b>ALDI (location)</b></li> 
A well-known chain around the UK, ALDI is the place where you will get the most for your money. Unfortunately, it is located in the city center which is about a 20-30 minute walk from the campus and you might not want to carry all of your shopping from there.<br>

<li><b>ASDA (location)</b></li>
At ASDA you can find anything for your fridge, whether you want fresh or frozen, fast food or the right spice for a specific dish you can find it there. <br>

<li><b>Sainsbury's (location/s)</b></li>
Sainsbury's has the most shops out of all of them however the variety of products is not that big and the prices are a bit higher because the locations are conveniently placed. They are ideal for small shopping.<br>

<li><b>Local shops</b></li>
Local shops don't tend to be price friendly. They also do not accept card payments from some international banks and prefer cash. However, they are the closest to the accommodations out of all of them.</p>

                <h2>Shopping - Tips and Tricks</h2>
                <p>
  If you do not know what to cook and what to buy, take a recipe for a dish you like from the web and buy the ingredients. Or get inspired by our <a href="" title="">food ideas</a>.<br>
  If you want to save money and you have a friend you can trust you can buy larger amounts of food and split it.<br>
  If you don’t want to deal with crowds of people make sure to avoid shopping on Friday and Saturday.<br>
  Sessions are the least likely time you will want to go shopping so make sure you have enough food to put your studies on priority.<br>
