            <h2 id="budgeting"> Student Loans/Budgeting </h2>
            <p>This mainly applies to UK students. Or people that are eligible for a student loan. Most students rely on this as their only income to live.
It’s split up into three instalments so you won’t get it all at once. Personally getting it like this made it easier for me to budget.</p><p>FOR UK STUDENTS:<br>Maintenance loan – This is the base of your loan. Student loan will decide depending on your living situation.</p> 
<p> Grant – You won’t have to pay this back if you complete your university degree.</p>

  <p> Talking from personal experience, when I was in first year I had never lived on my own before or had to manage my money.</p>        
<p>All the financial choices I made affected my daily living. 
As a first year I loved to go to; events, restaurants and clubs and the bills slowly added up. 
In the end I had to ask the bank for overdraft to help me through month three of my loan. 
And the following instalments of my loan I budgeted properly. 
A tip I would give to upcoming students is try to take out money for shopping then a bit of emergency money then use the rest for whatever you please this does ensure you won’t be in a situation like me.</p>

            <h2 id="employment"> Employment</h2>
            <p>Many students including myself get part time jobs in-between university time to get a little extra money in their pocket. That big extra a month is helpful, I use it to buy shoes, going out and clothes. <p>I don’t have to worry about overspending because all the money I earn in part time work can go towards me. Working can have benefits such as discounts for the company you work for I work at Argos so I get a discount at Sainsbury’s and this lets me have a cheaper weekly shop for groceries. </p>

          <div class="page-article1-text">
           <p>Most of you would have worked in college so you could just get a transfer to a different branch but some things to look out for is when employers give you 0 hour contracts. The amount you get can vary depending on how many hours they give you. Try to get a contract that gives you minimum 12 hours a week this way you know you have a base income. </p>
<p>For me it was hard to go home because I had a work contract. So I discussed with my manger to get half terms off so I could travel home and wouldn’t have to worry about work! </p>
