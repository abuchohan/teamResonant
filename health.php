             <h2>Staying Healthy</h2>
             <p>It can be difficult to maintain your health throughout your university experience and the nights out may get to you after a while. It is reccomended by doctors to eat 5 pieces of fruit or vegetable each day and aim to get about an hour of excersise each day although every little helps. This could be a run around the block, a bike ride round the city or for the more determined, a gym membership.</p>
             <h2>Sleeping</h2>
             <p>Sleeping is necessary in order for us to function normally as human beings. A study has shown that students that get 7-9 hours of sleep at night tend to score higher marks than those who sleep either less or more. It is simply because if you let your brain recover from the tasks given to it in the previous day it will help you concentrate easier, you will lose less focus and you will be able to think of better ideas when it comes to your projects.  
             You will also have more day time which will make you feel more productive in general.
             </p>
             <h2>Doctors</h2>
             <p>It is recommended that you register as soon as possible because that might save you precious time if you want immediate treatment of your illness. You can also ask at reception for further details if you wish to book online.<br>
